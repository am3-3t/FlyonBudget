# FlyonBudget
Brief: FlyonBudget is written with python. It is useful for travelers to set a budget and travel. (More on readme)
FlyonBudget is one of my capstone project. The aim of this project is to let users set a budget to different destinations. 
This python scripts then using Kiwi Tequila API searches for the flights that are equal or less than the budgeted price. 
The flights whose prices are less than our fixed budget, it emails the user about the ticket fare drop. 

The project is set for direct flights only for now. If there is no direct flights to destination, it simply ignores. 
I am working on getting the flights with 1 - 2 step overs which could be more beneficial to users.
